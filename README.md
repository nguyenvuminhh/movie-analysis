# Movie Analysis

## Goal
The aim of the project was to find
surprising patterns within the data, such
as fluctuations of the average ratings over
the years, or the distribution of
percentages of adult movies over 5-year
intervals

## Datasets
The project used publicly available
datasets from IMDb
- The base dataset is called "title basics" and
contains unique identifiers of the title,
release year, runtime in minutes, AdultBoolean, title type, and genre
- The additional dataset is called "title
ratings" and contains uniqueidentifiers,
average rating, and number of votes
